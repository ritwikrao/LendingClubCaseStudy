## General Information
- This project focuses on trying to find the patterns exhibited by the customers who have applied for loans and who are likely to default
- This is a case study project purely done for educational purposes
- Business requirement that the project is addressing is to identify customers who are likely to default in their loans and turn down their loan application. On the contrary this will also help us to identify customers who are likely to pay their loans off and would be identified as an asset to the company.
- Dataset is from a US based company called Lending Club that has got around 38000 records of customer who have applied for loans in the years of 2007 to 2011.

## Obsevations:
   - Lending Club should be wary of the loans where the purpose is Small Business as the percentage of a loan being charged off is almost 30%
   - Lending Club should consider accepting more loans from applicants whose annual income is greater than 30K as their probablity of charge off is minimum.
   - Lending Club should consider accepting more loans from people with own house ownership.
   - Lending Club should consider accepting more loans from people who are source verified.
   - The number of loan are increasing with each passing year which is good for Lending Club.The last few months of the year are quite critical as most of the loans are either fully paid or cdefaulted at that time.
   - Lending Club should consider accepting more loans of grade A than B as B contributes more to defaulted loans due to higher interest rates.
   - Higher interest rates and less loan term is contributing to defaulted loans so Lending Club should look at the grades for loans before accepting as loan grade is proportional to term and interest rates.
   - Wyoming is contributing to higer defaultes for higher loan amount so maybe Lending Club shoulf look at the spike.
